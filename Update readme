### ✅ Evaluation Requirements Covered

- ✅ **30-minute default expiry**: If the user doesn't specify a validity period, the link expires in 30 minutes.
- ✅ **Optional custom shortcode**: Users can provide their own alphanumeric code for the shortened URL.
- ✅ **Shorten 5 URLs at once**: Form dynamically supports up to 5 concurrent URL shortening requests.
- ✅ **Click tracking and stats**: Tracks each click with timestamp, referrer, and simulated location data.
- ✅ **Remote logging middleware**: All critical user actions and states are logged to a protected remote API endpoint.
- ✅ **Material UI only (no external CSS libraries)**: UI is built entirely using Material UI components and theming.
- ✅ **Full client-side routing & redirection**: Redirection from short URLs is handled entirely via React Router DOM.
